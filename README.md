Acceptenence Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards x
WHEN I view the source code x 
THEN I find semantic HTML elements x
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements x
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning x
WHEN I view the image elements x
THEN I find accessible alt attributes x
WHEN I view the heading attributes x
THEN they fall in sequential order x
WHEN I view the title element x
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title x

The above acceptenence criteria list shows an "x" at the end of each line. This is so I could keep track of what I was doing while going through the code. 

*I changed the <title> so the browser tab shows a more precise name 

*Element <div> were changed to <footer> <section> <nav> to meet accessibility standards 

*I added naming lines at the start and end the elements to help create seperation within the html and css stylesheet

*The css stylesheet was condensed after finding the same styles for multiple classes. Labels were added as needed

*I confirmed the <head> attributes made orderly sense

*Finally, I confirmed all the links on the page are operating and the layout mimics the provided image in the challenge instructions
